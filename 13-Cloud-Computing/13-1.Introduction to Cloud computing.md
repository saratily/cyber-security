## Overview
- Different cloud services and their use based on organization need
- Set up a virtual private cloud network.
- Protect the cloud network with a firewall, creating firewall rules
- Deploy a virtual computer to your a network- creating web VMs (web-1 & web-2) in the cloud instance, and a jump box

## ON-premise machine VS VM
| ON-premise machine | Virtual Machine in CLoud |
|----|-----|
| have a larger footprint and require bigger space.  ||
| physical host makes them more space-efficient ||
| Migration from one physical server to another is difficult and complex | can be seamlessly moved across the virtualized environment |
| Machines depricate over time | Provides upto date h/w & s/w|


## Services provided by Cloud

| |Service          |                   | Description | Benefits | Example               |
|-|-----------------| ----------------- |-- | ----------------- | -----|
|1| IaaS            | Infrastructure    | pay-as-you-go access to storage,networking, servers, and other computing resources in the cloud. | high availability, upto date quipment, Provider-enforced security controls  |AWS, Azure, Google cloud |
|2| PaaS            | Platform          | offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver applications.  | provider supplies underline infrastructure (almost everything), You manage application only  |Azure Classroom Labs |
|3| SaaS            | Software          | delivers software and applications through the internet| - get s/w through web or vedor API, - guaranteed secure env, - secure deployments |Office 365, Apple iWork |
|4| Daas / DbaaS    | Data / Datbase    | provides data to the user on demand, regardless of geographic or distance b/w provider and consumer| - high availability and fault tolerance, |An example of a DaaS is a marketing company that keep databases of consumers categorized for many different industries|
|5| CaaS            | Communication     | can include Voice over IP (VoIP or internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), and collaboration or video conference applications. | CaaS guarantees security by ensuring that communications are not vulnerable to eavesdropping, and provides comprehensive monitoring/record-keeping for auditing purposes.|Zoom, FaceTime, Skype, GoToMeeting |
|6| XaaS            | Anything          |  provide all the offerings via cloud computing as opposed to locally, or on-premises | Communication, data and s/w all in one place | |

## 0. Availability Region - US West 3
- When selecting the resources for your cloud environment, you will need to select a region indicating where the resource geographically located.
- It is important to keep all resources in the same geographic region, as resources
work together more efficiently when they are located physically close to each other.
- Ideally all geographic regions would always be available. However, that is not the
case with cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure.
- Therefore, it is important to determine an available region before we create any
cloud resources.
- For instance, US West 2 does noy have some resources

## 1. Resourse group - RedTeam
    |_ logical grouping of all resources used for a particular setup or project.
    |_ allow engineers to sort related resources into different groups, each of which can be easily located by name.

### DEMO - Setting Up Resource Groups

## 2. Virtual network - RedTeamNet
    |_ a collection of virtual machines that can communicate with each other
    |_ VMs on a virtual network can live in different data centers but perform as if they are wired, and provide improved availability.
    |_ Virtual networks can be quickly and easily reconfigured by clicking a few buttons in the portal.
    |_ This is dramatically faster and safer than rewiring a physical network to implement improved segmentation. It also results in less human error.

### SPECIFICATION
```
vNICs (virtual network interface cards)
    |_ Similar to physical machines, VMs have software versions of “normal” NICs.
    |_ Just like physical machines, VMs can have multiple vNICs.
IP addresses
    |_ VMs have IP addresses, just like physical computers.
    |_ IP addresses are considered their own type of resource in Azure, AWS, and other cloud environments.
Subnets
    |_ Like IP addresses, subnets are considered separate resources in the cloud, meaning they can be created independently of other resources.
    |_ After creating a virtual network, we can create a new virtual subnet and add it to the existing network.
    |_ We can also create a new public IP address resource and associate it with an existing virtual machine.
```

### IP Address Structures
|                       |                   | 
|-----------------------|------------------ |
| Private IP adress     | 192.168.x.x       |
|                       | 172.16.x.x        |
|                       | 10.x.x.x          |
| CIDR                  | 192.168.1.0/24    |
| For the large network | 10.0.0.0/16       |
| For the first subnet  | 10.10.1.0/24      |

### Activity: Virtual Networking 

## 3. Network security group RedTeamSG
    |_ Basic firewall
    |_ Add rules for inbound and outbound traffic
    |_ Many resources can be created independently of any particular Vnet and then attached to a VNet after creation. 
    |_ NSGs are a perfect example of this concept. 

### DEMO - Setting Up Security Groups
- create an NSG that blocks all traffic to and from the network, and then attach it to the VNet
- This model has the advantage of allowing security engineers to create NSGs for different traffic profiles, which they can then replicate and apply to any VNet.
. We can create an NSG called Desktop Connections, which clears RDP and VNC traffic
to and from the VNet
- Engineers can then use this NSG as a template, clone it, and apply it to any new or existing VNet that requires this type of access.

## 4. Virtual Computing/Virtual Machines - Jump-Box, Web-1, Web-2

### Componenets for defining Hardware
| Componenets  | Definition |
| --- | --- |
|RAM (random access memory) | The amount of memory dedicated to running computer operations. The computer uses RAM to temporarily store data that it needs to access quickly. |
| Storage (HDD / SSD) | The part of the computer that stores data permanently. This is data that you do not expect to lose when the computer is turned off. |
| Disks | Disks attached to a VM fall into two general categories: - OS disks contain the operating system, kernel, and everything required for the VM to function - Data disks contain data that the VM doesn’t need in order to run, but which users need to do their jobs. |
| CPU (central processing unit) | CPU is like the brain of the computer. It’s the part that actually computes all the 1s and 0s. The CPU takes code and data out of the long term storage, loads it into RAM, and performs the computations specified by an application. |

### Availability vs. Cost Tradeoff
While it is possible to simply choose the “best” option available, it’s not advisable.
- The cloud provides great flexibility for users, but this flexibility can come at a cost.
- Before working with devices on the cloud, we must always set budget limits and cost-control policies.
- Otherwise, we can accidentally exceed our employer’s budget.
- Azure provides cost-control tools as a free service, which you should study prior to managing live cloud deployments
